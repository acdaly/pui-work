Reflection:

What challenges or bugs did you encounter and how did you overcome the
challenges?

It was really difficult for me to figure out how to create equally spaced images that would fit the screen at different window sizes. I ended up looking back at the codacademy tutorials, and referenced the way they used grids for their images. Those tutorials didn't quite perfectly align with what I was trying to do, so it took some googling and trial and error to eventually come up with something that worked.

How is the brand identity of your client reflected through your design choices?
What kind of look and feel did you design for them and why?

My client, Flip Stitch Pillow, is a Pittsburgh based pillow company. Pittsburgh is a city that's a bit tough, known for its industrialization, but also quickly modernizing as it becomes a hub for technology. I used black throughout the design to give the site a modern, minimal, gender neutral, and tough look. 

I felt that it's particularly important to keep the site relatively gender neutral in its theme to combat stereotypical idea that decorative pillows and home decor in general is feminine (and even what it means to be feminine). Keeping the design inclusive will keep the brand modern and help it appeal to a wider audience.
